### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Here is some stuff from my old website

* [The Programmer's Oath](//blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html)
* [Conventional Commits](//www.conventionalcommits.org)

I saw a list of "programming pearls" from the September 1985 issue of "Communications of the ACM". I picked a few out and added some that weren't on the list and ever since, I've always kept a printed version near where I work. Over the years I've added some and deleted some. Here is my current list:

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. (Fowler)
> 
> Debug only code - comments can lie.
> 
> If you have too many special cases, you are doing it wrong.
> 
> Get your data structures correct first, and the rest of the program will write itself.
> 
> Testing can show the presence of bugs, but not their absence.
> 
> The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatedly.
> 
> The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast and much easier to understand.
> 
> The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there.
> 
> Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.
> 
> Don't use the computer to do things that can be done efficiently by hand.
> 
> [Thompson's Rule for first-time telescope makers] It is faster to make a four-inch mirror then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror.
> 
> If you lie to the computer, it will get you.
> 
> Inside of every large program is a small program struggling to get out.
